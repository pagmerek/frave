# `frave`
![fractals](img/fractals.gif)

`frave` is an image compression algorithm based on complex-base system fractals.

## Decomposition of an image
Unlike other compression algorithms `frave` works on tame-twindragon fractals rather than on blocks. 

## Compression pipeline
- Decomposing image to fractals using complex-base numeral systems
- Saving the residues of each block
- Quantization based on dividing the smallest layer of fractals
- Entropy coding with ANS

## Compression rates
> TBD!
